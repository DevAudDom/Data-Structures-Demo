Data Structures Repository

What the project does

This repository is a collection of header, implementations and demonstrations files for various data structures encountered during my COP 3530 (Data Structures) course and beyond. 

Why the project is useful

Understanding data structures is fundamental to becoming a proficient programmer or computer scientist. By studying and implementing these data structures, developers can improve their problem-solving skills, optimize algorithm efficiency, and build more robust and scalable software applications.

Goals for the project

As I continue this course and genearlly grow as a Software Engineer, I will continue to cement my knowledge on Data Structures by updating this repo with more classes and more implementation files. For now I'm planning to add:
  - Stacks & Queues
  - Trees

Currently Included:
- Linked List
